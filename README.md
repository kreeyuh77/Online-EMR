# Online-EMR
Online EMR is a  therapy practice management system that I help support with bug fixes, custom code additions, database management and more. Additionally, I created and manage their website. 

**Technical Notes: </br>**
The Online EMR application is powered by OpenEMR and uses PHP and mySQL.
